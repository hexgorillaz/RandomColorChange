# RandomColorChange
Python GUI Random Color Change
This Python app displays a square image on the screen and allows the user to change the color of the image by clicking a button. The color of the image is randomly generated using hexadecimal color codes.

## Setup
To set up and run this app, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You will also need to install the tkinter library, which provides a set of functions for creating GUI (graphical user interface) elements such as windows, buttons, and labels.

1. First, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to store the app.
2. Install the tkinter library by running the following command:

`
pip install tkinter
`
